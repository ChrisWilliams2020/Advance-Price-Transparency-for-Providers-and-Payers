# Assets Directory

This directory contains all static assets for the Advanced Price Transparency application.

## Structure

- `images/` - Screenshots, diagrams, logos, and promotional images
- `icons/` - SVG icons, favicon files, and UI icons
- `fonts/` - Custom fonts (if needed)

## Guidelines

- Use optimized images (WebP preferred, fallback to PNG/JPG)
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for web performance
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `dashboard-screenshot.png`)
- SVG icons preferred for scalability
